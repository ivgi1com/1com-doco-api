# Decisions Log

Record decisions that should not be repeatedly re-litigated.

## 2026-09-24 — Initial architecture direction

Decision:
Use a modern developer-portal architecture rather than a static documentation-only site.

Direction:
- Next.js
- React
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS
- MDX
- OpenAPI-compatible internal model

Status:
Approved in planning discussion.

---

## 2026-09-24 — Proxy API first

Decision:
Proxy API is the pilot API because its smaller documentation surface makes it suitable for validating the architecture.

Status:
Approved in planning discussion.

---

## 2026-09-24 — One-endpoint prototype gate

Decision:
Implement exactly one suitable real Proxy API endpoint end-to-end before scaling.

Status:
Approved in planning discussion.

---

## 2026-09-24 — Demo environment

Decision:
Demo mode uses the same Playground UI but a separate Demo provider and never touches production systems.

Status:
Approved in planning discussion.

---

## 2026-09-24 — No-guessing protocol

Decision:
Material ambiguity requires clarification rather than silent assumptions.

Status:
Approved in planning discussion.

---

## 2026-09-24 — Git workflow

Decision:
Use `main` as the approved stable branch plus phase branches and approval tags.

Status:
Approved in planning discussion.

---

## 2026-09-24 — Model routing

Decision:
- Sonnet 5 is the default implementation model.
- Opus 5.5 handles high-consequence architecture/security/review.
- Haiku 4.5 is restricted to low-risk repetitive work.

Status:
Approved in planning discussion.

---

## 2026-09-24 — Phase 1 setup choices

Decision:
- Git initialized locally: `main` baseline + `phase/design-research`. No remote.
- Research tooling: WebSearch/WebFetch + Playwright screenshots (scratchpad, not committed) + `impeccable` rules in place of UI/UX Pro Max (not installed).
- Brand cues derived from public 1com.co.il, marked UNCONFIRMED.
- Locales: English + Hebrew (RTL) from the start.

Status:
Approved by user (plan approval, 2026-09-24).

---

## 2026-09-24 — Design direction (Phase 1 output)

Decision:
- Restrained color strategy on brand-hue-tinted neutrals; brand indigo (official) `#3731ee` as accent, violet `#781df0` as hover; lightened tint for dark mode.
- Light + dark, default follows OS; code/JSON surfaces dark in both.
- Assistant (official brand font; UI, Hebrew+Latin) + JetBrains Mono (code).
- Radii 4/6/10px.
- Three-column endpoint layout with sticky request panel; nothing hidden on mobile.
- Dedicated Playground route with persistent Live/Demo mode bar (amber Live, teal Demo) and per-response source stamp.
- Four lifecycle states shown as page banner + inline badge.

Status:
Approved by user at Phase 1 gate (2026-09-24). See `design-system/MASTER.md` "Resolved decisions".

Deferred (non-blocking):
- SVG logo availability (only raster PNG known).
- Hebrew content scope (chrome / guides / reference prose) — decide before Phase 3/4 content model.
- Sign-in / Console link destination — decide before Phase 2 nav is finalized.
- Whether to commit reference screenshots (currently no).

---

## 2026-09-24 — Process notes

Decision:
- `impeccable` init (PRODUCT.md creation) skipped: outside approved Phase 1 file scope.
- Reference-portal screenshots not committed (third-party imagery); regenerable.

Status:
Applied; revisit at gate if user prefers otherwise.

---

## 2026-09-24 — Phase 1 merge

Decision:
`phase/design-research` fast-forward merged into `main` (`dc5f5bc`).

Status:
Approved by user.

---

## 2026-09-24 — Phase 2 setup

Decision:
- Toolchain: Node 24.15.0 (LTS), npm 12.0.2. Next.js 16.3.6 (App Router, `src/`), React 19.2.8, TypeScript 5.9, Tailwind CSS 4.3.3, next-intl 4.14.7 (`/en`, `/he` prefixes via `src/proxy.ts`), shiki 4 (server-side highlighting), lucide-react (icons), vitest 5, @playwright/test 1.63.
- Prototype content: synthetic, clearly labelled "Sample API" (fictional endpoints, example.com host, 555-01xx numbers). No Proxy API claims before the Phase 3 audit.
- Header branding: official raster PNG logo from 1com.co.il, rendered as a CSS mask in theme ink colour. Swap for the SVG logo when it is provided.
- Console button: present but inert ("not available yet") until the destination is decided.
- Hebrew: UI chrome strings drafted by Claude, marked DRAFT for native review. API content prose stays English with a "not translated yet" banner until the Hebrew scope is decided.
- `AGENTS.md` added so `next dev` writes its agent rules there rather than into `CLAUDE.md`.

Status:
Approved by user (2026-09-24), except the implementation details noted as reversible.
