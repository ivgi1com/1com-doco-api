# Decisions Log

Record decisions that should not be repeatedly re-litigated.

## 2026-09-24 — Initial architecture direction

Decision:
Use a modern developer-portal architecture rather than a static documentation-only site.

Direction:
- Next.js
- React
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS
- MDX
- OpenAPI-compatible internal model

Status:
Approved in planning discussion.

---

## 2026-09-24 — Proxy API first

Decision:
Proxy API is the pilot API because its smaller documentation surface makes it suitable for validating the architecture.

Status:
Approved in planning discussion.

---

## 2026-09-24 — One-endpoint prototype gate

Decision:
Implement exactly one suitable real Proxy API endpoint end-to-end before scaling.

Status:
Approved in planning discussion.

---

## 2026-09-24 — Demo environment

Decision:
Demo mode uses the same Playground UI but a separate Demo provider and never touches production systems.

Status:
Approved in planning discussion.

---

## 2026-09-24 — No-guessing protocol

Decision:
Material ambiguity requires clarification rather than silent assumptions.

Status:
Approved in planning discussion.

---

## 2026-09-24 — Git workflow

Decision:
Use `main` as the approved stable branch plus phase branches and approval tags.

Status:
Approved in planning discussion.

---

## 2026-09-24 — Model routing

Decision:
- Sonnet 5 is the default implementation model.
- Opus 5.5 handles high-consequence architecture/security/review.
- Haiku 4.5 is restricted to low-risk repetitive work.

Status:
Approved in planning discussion.

---

## 2026-09-24 — Phase 1 setup choices

Decision:
- Git initialized locally: `main` baseline + `phase/design-research`. No remote.
- Research tooling: WebSearch/WebFetch + Playwright screenshots (scratchpad, not committed) + `impeccable` rules in place of UI/UX Pro Max (not installed).
- Brand cues derived from public 1com.co.il, marked UNCONFIRMED.
- Locales: English + Hebrew (RTL) from the start.

Status:
Approved by user (plan approval, 2026-09-24).

---

## 2026-09-24 — Design direction (Phase 1 output)

Decision (proposed):
- Restrained color strategy on brand-hue-tinted neutrals; brand indigo `#3731ee` as accent, violet `#781df0` as hover; lightened tint for dark mode.
- Light + dark, default follows OS; code/JSON surfaces dark in both.
- Assistant (UI, Hebrew+Latin) + JetBrains Mono (code).
- Three-column endpoint layout with sticky request panel; nothing hidden on mobile.
- Dedicated Playground route with persistent Live/Demo mode bar (amber Live, teal Demo) and per-response source stamp.
- Four lifecycle states shown as page banner + inline badge.

Status:
PROPOSED — awaiting user approval at Phase 1 gate. See `design-system/RESEARCH.md`, `design-system/MASTER.md`.

---

## 2026-09-24 — Process notes

Decision:
- `impeccable` init (PRODUCT.md creation) skipped: outside approved Phase 1 file scope.
- Reference-portal screenshots not committed (third-party imagery); regenerable.

Status:
Applied; revisit at gate if user prefers otherwise.
